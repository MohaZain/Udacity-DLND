# Udacity-DLND

Throughout this Nanodegree program I learned:

  - implement Neural Networks using the deep learning framework PyTorch.
  - Build convolutional networks for image recognition.
  - Recurrent networks for sequence generation.
  - Generative adversarial networks for image generation.
  - deploy models accessible from a website using amazon segmamaker.
  
 *To Pass the nanaodegree You need to pass all the five project*
 
 
# DLND Projects
<h4> 1- Project: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns (Neural Networks):</h4>

 - In this project, I build and train  Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.
  
<h4> 2- Project: Dog-Breed Classifier (Convolutional Neural Networks):</h4>

  - In this project, I learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.
  
<h4> 3- Project: Generate TV Scripts (Recurrent Neural Networks):</h4>

  - Generate a TV script by defining and training a recurrent neural network.

<h4> 4- Project: Generate Faces (Generative Adversarial Networks):</h4>

   - Define two adversarial networks, a generator and discriminator, and train them too generate realistic faces.
   
<h4> 5- Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model:</h4>

   - I constructed a recurrent neural network for determining the sentiment of a movie review (Positive or negative) using the IMDB data set. created this model
   using Amazon's SageMaker service.
I deployed the model and construct a simple web app which interacts with the deployed model.
